Some random tools/code, with the goal of learning more coding.
<br>
## convert_tensor.py
It should convert a pytorch tensor to a png image and it can retrieve the tensor back using the png image and the min and max value of the tensor. Some tensors might be retrieved badly because its limit is 24 bits (#ffffff).
<br>
<br>
<br>
## array_to_midi.py
I used it to convert an array of prime numbers to midi, for better song I recommend using arrays that grows through time like prime numbers, otherwise It will sound not very good.
<br>
<br>
<br>
## sine_compression.py
It's not very otimized, but it tries to fuse two arrays in one and retrieve an approximation of both, I used a very high frequency sine function on it.
